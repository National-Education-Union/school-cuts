# School cuts methodology
An analysis of school funding in England

## School funding
We took the grant funding for every school in 2015-16 and compared it with 2020-21.
Grant funding is all the revenue funding the Government allocates to schools. It includes:
- Funding for 2- to 16-year-olds (I01),
- Special needs funding (I02),
- Sixth-form funding (I03),
- Pupil Premium (I04),
- Funding for pupils with Education and Health Care Plans (I05),
- Funding for minority ethnic pupils (I06),
- Other grants such as the milk subsidy (I07),
- Funding for extended schools (I15),
- Funding to be attributed to community-focused activities (I16), and
- Additional grants for schools such as the primary PE and sports grant and universal infant free school meal funding (I18). For 2020-21, this also includes funding for coronavirus mtigation and catch-up funding for pupils.

The source for this data is from the [Schools financial benchmarking](https://schools-financial-benchmarking.service.gov.uk/Help/DataSources) and the full description of the funding elements is described in the [Consistent financial reporting framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consistent-financial-reporting-framework-2020-to-2021/income).

## School costs index
We have updated and extended the index of school costs published by the National Audit Office in their report, ["Financial sustainability of schools"](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Financial-sustainability-of-schools.pdf).

This chart shows cumulative costs pressures facing schools, 2016-17 to 2019-20

We have used these figures for additional National Insurance costs and the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. We have used the Department for Education (DfE) documents:

### Non-staff costs
We have updated non-staff costs with the latest estimates for the GDP deflator measure of inflation from HM Teasury, [GDP deflators at market prices, and money GDP March 2022 (Spring Statement)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1062965/GDP_Deflators_Spring_Statement_March_2022_update.xlsx).

### Support staff pay
The DfE documents uses the National Joint Council (NJC) pay awards, which cover all local authority staff. However, school support staff are paid signifcantly less well paid than council staff and many are employed on the minimum wage. In recent years, there have been significant uplifts in the minimum wage. We made an index for school support staff pay by sending Freedom of Information requests to a sample of local authorities and then tracked the value of those pay points back to 2009-10 and weighted them by the number of staff paid on each grade. The increases in the minimum wage have had a substantial impact on school support staff pay and their pay has risen much faster than the headline rates for the NJC awards.
